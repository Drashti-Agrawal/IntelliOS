IntelliOS Re-Architecture: An Agentic AI Framework for Proactive Workspace Management


Section 1: Strategic Rationale for an Agentic IntelliOS: From Prediction to Proaction


1.1 The Original Vision and Its Limitations

The IntelliOS project's foundational goal is to address a significant challenge in modern digital workflows: the productivity loss professionals experience from the repetitive setup of applications, files, and configurations when switching between devices.1 The vision of providing "full workspace restoration" and "seamless cross-device workspace continuity" is both ambitious and highly relevant.
However, the proposed technical solution, while innovative, is architecturally constrained by its reliance on traditional machine learning paradigms. The "AI Prediction & Learning Layer" is designed to employ models such as K-Means clustering and Time Series Analysis (ARIMA/LSTM) to forecast user needs based on historical data.1 This approach frames the complex problem of user intent as a matter of statistical prediction. Such a system is inherently reactive; it can only extrapolate from past behaviors and is ill-equipped to handle novel tasks or dynamic shifts in a user's context. It predicts a likely future based on a static interpretation of the past, rather than understanding and acting upon the user's present goal. This fundamental limitation makes the system brittle and prevents it from becoming the truly adaptive "intelligent assistant" envisioned in the project's abstract.1

1.2 A Paradigm Shift: Agentic AI as the True Enabler

A more robust and effective architecture can be achieved by shifting from a predictive model to a proactive, agentic one. Agentic AI refers to systems that operate with autonomy, initiative, and adaptability to pursue goals with limited human supervision.2 Unlike traditional AI models that follow preset rules or generate content based on learned patterns, agentic systems can perceive their environment, reason about a course of action, and execute complex, multi-step tasks by interacting with a suite of tools.3
This paradigm shift is critical for IntelliOS. An agentic system does not merely predict a probable workspace configuration. Instead, it perceives the user's explicit or implicit goal (e.g., "resume coding," "prepare for a meeting"), formulates a plan to achieve that goal, and then autonomously executes the necessary actions—launching applications, opening specific files, and arranging the digital environment. This aligns perfectly with the IntelliOS objective of creating a system that "adapts and evolves," moving beyond static restoration to intelligent, goal-oriented action.1

1.3 Re-architecting "Digital DNA" as a Dynamic State, Not a Static Dataset

The original proposal's most innovative concept is the "digital DNA (dDNA)," a dynamic user profile that learns and evolves with user behavior.1 The initial architecture treats this dDNA as a historical dataset—a repository of past actions to be mined by predictive models.1 This perspective fundamentally misunderstands the nature of a user's workflow, which is a living, real-time process. The core challenge is one of
state management, not historical prediction.
An agentic architecture built using the LangGraph framework allows for a powerful re-conceptualization of dDNA. LangGraph is designed around a central, persistent State object that is passed between different nodes (agents) in a workflow, allowing it to be updated and enriched at each step.6 By mapping the concept of dDNA directly to this LangGraph
State, it is transformed from a passive, historical record into an active, real-time context manager. It no longer just stores what the user did; it represents what the user is doing now, including their current intent, device context, and active resources. This provides a far more accurate and powerful foundation for "context-aware workspace reconstruction".1
This architectural reframing also provides an elegant solution to the "AI Prediction Accuracy" risk identified in the initial feasibility analysis.1 LangGraph has built-in support for human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows, allowing for human oversight and intervention at critical points.7 When IntelliOS restores a workspace, the user might make small adjustments, such as closing an unneeded application or opening an additional file. In an agentic system, these actions are not just isolated events; they can be captured as direct updates to the persistent dDNA
State. This creates a real-time feedback loop where the user actively collaborates with the system to refine their own digital profile. The system becomes anti-fragile, continuously improving through direct interaction rather than relying on periodic and computationally expensive model retraining.

Section 2: A Multi-Agent LangGraph Architecture for Workspace Intelligence
2.1 From Monolithic Layers to a Collaborative Agent Ecosystem

The original layered architecture—with distinct strata for kernel monitoring, AI prediction, and restoration—is rigid and creates information silos.1 A more resilient and scalable alternative is a multi-agent system orchestrated by LangGraph. In this model, the complex task of workspace management is broken down into sub-tasks, each handled by a specialized agent. These agents collaborate by reading from and writing to the shared dDNA
State, mimicking the efficiency of a human team where each member has a specific role.9 This modular approach allows for greater flexibility; new capabilities can be added simply by creating new agents and tools, without requiring a complete overhaul of the system architecture.

2.2 Core Agents and Their Roles

A robust initial implementation for IntelliOS would consist of the following core agents, each functioning as a node within the LangGraph graph:
Supervisor Agent: This agent serves as the central orchestrator and entry point of the graph.9 It is powered by a sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) capable of complex reasoning.3 Upon receiving a trigger (e.g., user login), the Supervisor analyzes the initial State, determines the overarching user intent, and routes the workflow to the appropriate specialist agent.
Context Monitoring Agent: This agent replaces the passive "Kernel Monitoring and Hook Layer".1 It actively
perceives the user's environment by using a set of OS-level tools to gather real-time data on the current device, running processes, active windows, and network status. This rich, immediate context is used to populate the initial dDNA State, providing the foundation for all subsequent reasoning.3
Workspace Configuration Agent: This is the primary planning agent. It receives the context-rich State from the Supervisor and reasons about the optimal workspace configuration to fulfill the user's intent. It determines which applications to launch, files to open, browser tabs to restore, and even the ideal window layout. Its output is a structured, step-by-step execution plan, which it appends to the State.
Tool & Resource Agent: This agent is the executor of the system. It takes the structured plan from the Configuration Agent and translates it into action. It has access to a library of well-defined tools, such as a shell command executor, a file system API, and a browser controller. Each tool is a discrete function, allowing the agent to select the right tool for each step in the plan.6
State Synchronization Agent: This agent handles persistence and continuity. After a workspace is successfully restored or when a user session ends, this agent takes the final, updated dDNA State and securely synchronizes it with a cloud-based persistence layer, such as a managed PostgreSQL database.8 This ensures that the user's most current context is available for the next session, regardless of the device used.

2.3 Generative AI as the Reasoning Engine for Each Agent

The feasibility of this multi-agent architecture is predicated on the reasoning capabilities of modern Generative AI, specifically LLMs.11 Each agent in the proposed system is not a simple script but an LLM-powered entity given a specific role, a set of tools, and access to the shared
State. This represents a fundamental evolution from the original architecture's reliance on narrow, task-specific ML models.1
Where the original system's K-Means model could identify clusters of past behavior, it could not reason about the purpose behind that behavior. Where an ARIMA model could forecast a trend, it could not devise a multi-step plan to achieve a novel goal. In contrast, the Workspace Configuration Agent, powered by an LLM, can be given a prompt defining its persona and goal. When it receives a State containing task_intent: 'debugging_payment_api' and device_type: 'laptop', it can semantically reason that the user requires their IDE opened to the correct project, a terminal running the local server, and a browser tab open to the API documentation. This level of cognitive planning is impossible with the original statistical models. The proposed architecture replaces a simple prediction engine with a distributed cognitive system, where Generative AI provides the "brain" for each specialized agent to perform its role intelligently and collaboratively.

Section 3: LangGraph Implementation for Core User Workflows


3.1 The LangGraph Framework: Building the IntelliOS Graph

LangGraph provides the ideal low-level orchestration framework for implementing this agentic system.13 The entire IntelliOS workflow can be modeled as a
StateGraph. Each of the defined agents becomes a Node in this graph, and the transitions between them are defined by Edges. The central State object, which represents the dDNA, is passed to each node, which can read from it and return an updated version. This structure provides a clear, debuggable, and stateful way to build the complex, long-running workflows required by IntelliOS.6

3.2 Defining the dDNA State Object

To provide a concrete blueprint for development, the dDNA State can be defined using a structure like Python's TypedDict. This ensures consistency and type safety as the state is passed between agents.

Python


from typing import TypedDict, List, Dict, Optional

class DigitalDNAState(TypedDict):
    """
    A TypedDict representing the shared state (dDNA) for the IntelliOS agentic workflow.
    """
    user_id: str
    session_id: str
    current_task_intent: Optional[str]
    device_context: Dict
    active_applications: List
    browser_state: List
    terminal_sessions: List
    user_preferences: Dict
    execution_plan: Optional]
    execution_log: List[str]
    feedback: Optional[str]



3.3 Agentic Workflow Mapping for IntelliOS

The following table details how the proposed agentic architecture would handle the core user workflows identified for IntelliOS, directly mapping user needs to a concrete implementation plan within the LangGraph framework.

User Workflow & Persona
Triggering Event
Key State Elements Used
Agent Node Sequence (LangGraph)
Conditional Edges (Logic)
Enhanced Capability vs. Original Proposal
Workspace Restoration (Software Developer)
User logs into their primary development machine after a restart.
user_id, device_context, user_preferences, historical active_applications & terminal_sessions from last synced dDNA.
1. Context Monitor (Populates device_context) 2. Supervisor (Infers task_intent as "resume_last_dev_session") 3. Workspace Configurator (Generates execution_plan) 4. Tool & Resource Agent (Executes plan) 5. State Sync (Persists final state)
Supervisor -> Configurator: If task_intent contains "dev", route to developer-focused planning logic. Configurator -> Plan: If a git repo was active, the plan includes git status and docker-compose up commands.
Proactive Environment Setup: Instead of just reopening files (static restore), the agent proactively runs startup commands (e.g., starts dev server, pulls latest git changes), restoring the functional state of the workspace, not just its appearance. This directly addresses developer pain points.1
Cross-Device Sync (Designer)
Designer finishes work on their office desktop and opens their laptop at home.
user_id, session_id, device_context (new device), active_applications (from desktop), browser_state.
1. Context Monitor (Detects new device context) 2. Supervisor (Receives sync request, loads last state from desktop) 3. Workspace Configurator (Adapts layout for laptop screen) 4. Tool & Resource Agent (Launches Figma, browsers) 5. State Sync
Configurator Logic: If new_device.screen_res < old_device.screen_res, adapt window layout to avoid overlap. If new_device.os is different, map application paths accordingly.
Context-Aware Adaptation: Goes beyond simple file sync.1 The system intelligently adapts the window layout for the new screen size and resolution. It understands that "working on a laptop" is a different context than "working on a dual-monitor desktop" and adjusts the UI accordingly.
New Task Initiation (Student)
Student types into a natural language prompt: "Start my research for the history paper on the Roman Empire."
user_id, device_context, feedback (user prompt).
1. Supervisor (Parses NLU prompt to set task_intent = "history_research_roman_empire") 2. Workspace Configurator (Plans to open web browser, Zotero, and a new document) 3. Tool & Resource Agent (Executes plan) 4. State Sync
Supervisor Logic: Uses an LLM to parse the natural language query into a structured task_intent. This is a conditional entry point based on user input rather than a system event.
Goal-Oriented Initiation: The original system could only restore past sessions. This agentic system can create entirely new, goal-oriented workspaces from scratch based on a user's natural language command, acting as a true intelligent assistant.11


Section 4: Feasibility, Risk Mitigation, and Strategic Recommendations
4.1 Feasibility and Advantages

The proposed agentic architecture is not only feasible but offers significant advantages over the original design. Key benefits include:
Adaptability: The system can handle novel user tasks and goals without retraining, as the LLM-based agents can reason from first principles.4
Scalability: New capabilities, tools, and specialized agents can be added modularly to the LangGraph graph without disrupting existing workflows.9
Transparency and Debuggability: Agentic workflows can be complex, but the LangChain ecosystem provides tools like LangSmith for tracing, visualizing, and debugging agent trajectories and state transitions, offering crucial observability.13
This approach more effectively fulfills the core vision of a system that "evolves with the user's behavior" by creating a dynamic, reasoning-based architecture rather than a static, predictive one.1
4.2 Mitigating Project Risks with the Agentic Architecture

The agentic model provides superior mitigation for the key risks identified in the original project plan 1:
Data Privacy Concerns: The agentic design enables a robust privacy model. The Context Monitoring Agent can be designed to run entirely on the user's device, processing raw, sensitive data locally. It can then pass only high-level, structured, and non-identifiable intent signals (e.g., task_intent: 'coding') to the shared State. This enhances the original "hybrid local-cloud" concept by creating a strong privacy boundary at the agent level.
AI Prediction Accuracy: This risk is fundamentally addressed by shifting from prediction to proactive, goal-driven action and incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback, as detailed in Section 1.3. The system's effectiveness is continuously refined through user interaction, making it more resilient.
Cross-device Compatibility: The original proposal suggested "containerized environment abstractions" to manage this risk.1 The agentic model offers a more flexible solution. The
Workspace Configuration Agent can generate a platform-agnostic plan, while the Tool & Resource Agent is equipped with a library of platform-specific tools. At execution time, it selects the correct tool for the target OS (e.g., using the appropriate shell command for macOS vs. Linux), cleanly separating planning from execution.

4.3 Strategic Recommendations for Implementation

To ensure the successful development of an agentic IntelliOS, the following strategic recommendations should be adopted:
Tiered LLM Selection: Employ a tiered strategy for LLM selection to balance cost, speed, and reasoning capability. Use a fast, cost-effective model (e.g., Google Gemini Flash, Groq models) for high-frequency, lower-complexity tasks performed by agents like the Tool & Resource Agent. Reserve more powerful and expensive reasoning models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus) for the critical planning and orchestration tasks handled by the Supervisor and Workspace Configuration agents.
Prioritize OS Tool Development: The efficacy of the entire system hinges on the Tool & Resource Agent's ability to reliably interact with the underlying operating system. The initial development phase (Milestone 2) should prioritize the creation of a secure, robust, and comprehensive library of OS-level tools for launching applications, managing windows, interacting with the file system, and executing shell commands.
Embrace the Full LangChain Ecosystem: Leverage the entire LangChain ecosystem to accelerate development and ensure production readiness.
LangSmith: Integrate LangSmith from the outset for comprehensive debugging, tracing, and evaluation of agent performance.13 This observability is non-negotiable for managing the complexity of multi-agent systems.
LangGraph Platform: For deployment, utilize the LangGraph Platform.8 It provides managed, production-grade infrastructure for persistence, scalability, fault tolerance, and API hosting. This will allow the development team to focus on core agent logic rather than complex DevOps challenges, significantly accelerating the project timeline.1

That's an excellent and critical point. You've identified a key risk in the system design. Relying solely on a generated summary is indeed risky due to potential LLM hallucinations and loss of detail.
You are absolutely right. The goal is to create a robust and deterministic system. We should minimize the creative role of the LLM in the core classification logic and use the raw, structured data as the source of truth.
Here is the revised, more reliable approach and the detailed flow.

## The Revised Strategy: Separate Storage from Search
The core principle is the separation of concerns. The raw JSON object is the ground truth of what happened, and the vector embedding is merely a search index to help categorize it.
For Storage (Ground Truth): The complete, unaltered JSON object containing all captured metadata is the official record. This is what gets stored in your main dDNA repository (e.g., PostgreSQL or a document database). This ensures 100% data fidelity.
For Search (Semantic Index): Directly embedding a raw JSON string is ineffective because embedding models are trained on natural language, not code syntax. Therefore, we generate a factual, structured-to-text description from the JSON. This is not a creative "summary" but a deterministic conversion of facts into a sentence.
This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: the semantic search power of vectors and the absolute accuracy of the raw data.

## The Revised Detailed Flow (Minimizing LLM Risk)
Here is the updated, more robust flow for classifying user activity.
Step 1: Monitor and Capture Raw JSON (No Change)
The Context Monitor Agent captures the user's activity and structures it as a detailed JSON object. This object is the inviolable record of the session.
JSON
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-20T09:30:00Z",
  "duration_seconds": 1800,
  "applications": [
    {"name": "vscode.exe", "focus_time": 1200},
    {"name": "docker.exe", "focus_time": 300},
    {"name": "postman.exe", "focus_time": 300}
  ],
  "files_accessed": [
    "/projects/intellios/api/main.py",
    "/projects/intellios/docker-compose.yml"
  ],
  "window_titles": ["IntelliOS API - VS Code", "Docker Dashboard"]
}



Step 2: Generate Factual Description & Create Embedding (Key Revision)
Instead of asking an LLM to creatively summarize, the Workspace Configurator Agent uses a deterministic template to generate a factual description. This minimizes hallucination risk.
Structured-to-Text Conversion: A simple rule-based function converts the JSON into a descriptive string.
Template: Activity involved applications: [app_names]. Files accessed include: [file_names].
Output: "Activity involved applications: vscode.exe, docker.exe, postman.exe. Files accessed include: /projects/intellios/api/main.py, /projects/intellios/docker-compose.yml."
Create Embedding: This factual, low-risk string is sent to the embedding model to be converted into a session embedding. The vector now represents the raw facts, not a potentially flawed summary.

Step 3: Perform Semantic Search (No Change)
The new session embedding is used to query the Vector DB and find the closest matching topic embedding by calculating similarity scores.
Project IntelliOS - Backend: Score 0.93
AI Research Paper: Score 0.42

Step 4: Classify and Store the Raw JSON (Key Revision)
This is the most important change. The system stores the original data, not the summary.
Scenario A: Match to an Existing Topic
Condition: The top score (0.93) is above the confidence threshold.
Action:
The session is classified under the topic "Project IntelliOS - Backend."
The original, complete JSON object from Step 1 is written to the main dDNA database and linked to this topic. The text description and vector are now discarded; their only job was to find the correct category.
Scenario B: Creation of a New Topic
Condition: No topic scores are above the threshold.
Action:
An LLM is used creatively here, where it's safer: to suggest a name for the new topic (e.g., "API Development and Testing").
Once the user confirms, the new topic is created, its name is embedded and stored in the Vector DB.
Crucially, the original JSON object from Step 1 is stored as the first activity record for this new topic in the dDNA database.
Of course. You've hit the central challenge of reliable data extraction: balancing flexibility with accuracy. The solution is a hybrid, multi-layered approach that uses deterministic methods first and leverages LLMs only for specific, constrained tasks where they excel.
You don't rely on one tool; you create a "funnel" that guarantees accuracy by processing the data in stages.

## The Hybrid Funnel Strategy
Think of your data processing as a funnel. You start with the fastest, cheapest, and most accurate method at the top. Only the data that fails to be processed moves down to the next, more sophisticated layer. This minimizes cost and eliminates the risk of hallucination for the vast majority of your data.

## Layer 1: Deterministic Parsing (The Workhorse)
This layer will handle 80-90% of your log data with 100% accuracy.
Your concern about Regex being OS-specific is valid, but the solution isn't to abandon it; it's to abstract it. Instead of one "master regex," you create a library of parsers.
How it Works:
Identify Patterns: Analyze your log sources. Many logs, even if they seem messy, are semi-structured. For example: [TIMESTAMP] [PROCESS_ID] [EVENT_TYPE] Details...
Create Parsers: For each identified pattern and OS, write a specific, targeted parser or regex. For example, you'd have a windows_app_focus.parser or a macos_file_open.regex.
Apply Matching: When a log line comes in, your system first tries to match it against this library of high-precision parsers.
Why it's Better:
Accuracy: It's 100% accurate for the patterns it's designed for. There is no guesswork or hallucination.
Speed & Cost: It's incredibly fast and computationally cheap compared to an LLM call.
Generalization: You achieve generalization by building a collection of specific rules, not by trying to create one rule that fits everything.

## Layer 2: Constrained LLM Extraction (The Specialist)
This layer handles the complex, unstructured data that the deterministic parsers couldn't handle.
Here, you avoid hallucination by never asking the LLM to be creative. You force it to act like a data entry clerk filling out a form you provide. This technique is called Function Calling or Tool Use.
How it Works:
Define Your Schema: You define the exact JSON structure you want as your output. This can be a JSON Schema or a Pydantic class in Python.
Python
class ActivityLog(BaseModel):
  app_name: str
  event_type: Literal["file_open", "app_focus"]
  file_path: Optional[str] = None
  description: str




Make a Constrained Call: You pass the raw log line and this schema to the LLM. Your prompt is not "summarize this," but rather: "Extract the information from this log line and populate the ActivityLog schema. If a field is not present, leave it empty."
Receive Structured Data: The LLM's output is not a sentence; it's a guaranteed-to-be-valid JSON object that conforms to your schema. The model's creativity is completely constrained.
Why it's Better:
Near-100% Structural Accuracy: You eliminate the risk of the LLM inventing fields or creating malformed JSON.
Factual Grounding: The model is strongly encouraged to only extract data present in the log line, dramatically reducing the risk of inventing file names or actions.
Flexibility: It can understand natural language within logs (e.g., "User initiated shutdown for process...") that regex would struggle with.

## The Final, Reliable Workflow
Here is how you combine these layers to build your JSON objects with maximum accuracy:
Ingest a log line.
Attempt Layer 1: Try to match the line with your library of high-precision deterministic parsers.
Check for Success:
✅ If a parser matches: Great. You have your 100% accurate JSON object. Move to the next log line.
❌ If no parser matches: The line is passed to the next layer.
Execute Layer 2: Send the log line to the constrained LLM with the predefined JSON schema.
Check for Success:
✅ If the LLM populates the schema with high confidence: You have your JSON object. Move on.
❌ If the LLM returns empty fields or has low confidence: The system can flag this specific log line for manual review or place it in a separate queue for further analysis. This ensures no bad data pollutes your dDNA.
Of course. Here is a comprehensive implementation plan for the initial log processing script, detailed enough to be handed off to a code agent for development.

This plan follows the **hybrid funnel strategy**, prioritizing deterministic parsing for accuracy and speed, and using a constrained LLM for flexibility.

-----

### \#\# High-Level Objective

To create a Python script that reliably extracts structured data from Windows Event Logs. The script will fetch logs, attempt to parse them using a modular library of high-precision Regex patterns, and use a constrained LLM call for any logs that don't match a known pattern. The final output will be a list of standardized JSON objects.

-----

### \#\# Dependencies & Setup

Before coding, ensure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install wevtapi pydantic openai instructor
```

**Environment Variables:**
The script will require `OPENAI_API_KEY` to be set in the environment for the LLM layer to function.

**File Structure:**
Organize the code into the following files for modularity:

  * `config.py`: For storing constants and the Pydantic schema.
  * `log_fetcher.py`: For pulling logs from Windows.
  * `regex_parsers.py`: For the deterministic parsing logic.
  * `llm_layer.py`: For the fallback LLM parsing logic.
  * `main.py`: To orchestrate the entire workflow.

-----

### \#\# 1. Module: `log_fetcher.py` (The Collector)

This module is responsible for efficiently querying and fetching events from the Windows Event Log.

**`function fetch_windows_event_logs(channel, start_time_utc)`**

  * **Objective:** To retrieve log entries from a specific Windows Event Log channel (e.g., 'Application', 'System') from a given start time to the present.
  * **Implementation Details:**
      * Use the `wevtapi` library, which provides a direct and efficient interface to the Windows Eventing API.
      * The function should be a **Python generator** (`yield`) to handle a large number of logs without consuming excessive memory. Each yielded item should be the raw log message string.
      * Use an **XPath query** to filter events on the server side. This is far more optimal than fetching all logs and filtering in Python.
      * The `start_time_utc` parameter should be a `datetime` object. The function will format it into the required `SystemTime` format for the XPath query.
  * **Code Structure:**

<!-- end list -->

```python
# log_fetcher.py
from datetime import datetime, timezone
import wevtapi

def fetch_windows_event_logs(channel: str, start_time_utc: datetime):
    """
    Fetches and yields log messages from a specified Windows Event Log channel.

    Args:
        channel: The log channel to query (e.g., 'Application').
        start_time_utc: The UTC datetime to fetch logs from.
    """
    # ISO 8601 format with 'Z' for UTC is required for XPath
    time_str = start_time_utc.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')
    query = f"*[System[TimeCreated[@SystemTime>='{time_str}']]]"

    try:
        for event in wevtapi.EvtQuery(channel, query):
            # Yielding the message makes this memory-efficient
            yield event.System.Provider['Name'], event.RenderedText
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching logs from {channel}: {e}")

```

-----

### \#\# 2. Module: `regex_parsers.py` (The Deterministic Layer)

This module defines the library of parsers for common, well-structured log events.

  * **Objective:** To parse log messages against a list of known patterns and extract data into a dictionary.
  * **Implementation Details:**
      * Create a `PARSER_REGISTRY`, which is a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains the `provider_name`, the `regex` pattern, and a `handler` function to format the output.
      * Handlers receive the `re.match` object and return a dictionary conforming to a standard schema. This ensures consistent output.
      * The main function, `parse_with_regex`, will iterate through the registry and return the structured data from the first successful match.
  * **Code Structure:**

<!-- end list -->

```python
# regex_parsers.py
import re

def handle_app_error(match):
    """Handler for a standard Application Error event (Event ID 1000)."""
    groups = match.groupdict()
    return {
        "event_type": "application_crash",
        "app_name": groups.get("app_name"),
        "module_name": groups.get("module_name"),
        "error_code": groups.get("error_code")
    }

# A registry of all high-precision parsers. Easily extensible.
PARSER_REGISTRY = [
    {
        "provider_name": "Application Error",
        "regex": re.compile(

### \#\# 3. Module: `llm_layer.py` (The Specialist Layer)

This module is the fallback for parsing unknown log formats using a constrained LLM call.

  * **Objective:** To extract structured data from a log string by forcing an LLM to populate a predefined Pydantic schema.
  * **Implementation Details:**
      * First, define the target data structure in `config.py` using `Pydantic`.
      * Use the `instructor` library to patch the OpenAI client. This simplifies getting structured output.
      * The `parse_with_llm` function takes the log message, crafts a precise prompt instructing the model to *extract* and not *infer*, and makes the call with `response_model=ActivityLog`.
  * **Code Structure:**

<!-- end list -->

```python
# config.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, Literal

class ActivityLog(BaseModel):
    """Schema for a single structured log event."""
    event_type: Literal["file_interaction", "app_lifecycle", "system_event", "unknown"] = Field(
        ..., description="The high-level category of the event."
    )
    app_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The name of the application involved.")
    file_path: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The full path to the file involved.")
    summary: str = Field(..., description="A brief, factual summary of the log entry.")

# llm_layer.py
import openai
import instructor
from config import ActivityLog

# Patch the OpenAI client with instructor
client = instructor.patch(openai.OpenAI())

def parse_with_llm(message: str):
    """
    Parses a log message using a constrained LLM call.
    Returns a Pydantic object on success, or None on failure.
    """
    try:
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4-turbo",
            response_model=ActivityLog,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a world-class log parsing expert. Your task is to extract structured data from a raw log entry into the provided schema. Do not invent any information that is not present in the log."},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Here is the log entry:\n\n{message}"},
            ],
        )
        return response.dict() # Return as a dictionary
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"LLM parsing failed: {e}")
        return None
